# Recipe Site
My family and I always love to cook something new, but recipes often fly out of my head and I decided to create a website where you can post your recipes, see each other's recipes, mark your favorites. The client side of the site is written in React, and the server side in Node.js. It also contains such technologies and services as: Redux Toolkit, Firebase, MongoDB, cloudinary(API).
The site is deployed on Heroku.
As a result, we have a simple site that is ideal for the original purpose - a site where you can write down a recipe.
